# CUDA
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units) technology that allows programmers to implement algorithms in a simplified C programming language that can be implemented on graphics processors of eighth-generation GeForce video cards and older. CUDA technology was developed by Nvidia. In fact, CUDA allows you to include special functions in the text of a C program. These functions are written in the simplified C programming language and run on Nvidia GPUs.
